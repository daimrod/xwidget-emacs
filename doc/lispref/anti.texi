@appendix Emacs 22 Antinews

For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 22.3.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs @value{EMACSVER}
features.

@section Old Lisp Features in Emacs 22

@itemize @bullet
@item
The internal character representation in Emacs is no longer
Unicode-based; it is known as @code{emacs-mule}.  This representation
can handle several different variants of the same character, each one
belonging to its own script.  It marks each character with its script,
to better discern them from one another.

@item
The @code{functionp} function now returns @code{t} for special forms.

@item
The @code{^} interactive spec code has been removed, together with the
function @code{handle-shift-selection} and the variable
@code{this-command-keys-shift-translated}.  Shift-translated keys are
no longer treated specially, making Emacs' handling of keybindings
that much more consistent.

@item
The @code{interactive-form} symbol property is no longer recognized.
Once you supply a function with an interactive form, the only way to
change it is to redefine the function.

@item
Emacs no longer creates temporarily-active regions by giving the
variable @code{transient-mark-mode} values of the form @code{(only
. @var{oldvar})}.  Instead, it uses a more slightly more complicated
scheme: setting @code{transient-mark-mode} to @code{only} enables
Transient Mark mode for the following command only, during which the
value of @code{transient-mark-mode} is set to @code{identity}; if it
is still @code{identity} at the end of the command, Transient Mark
mode is disabled.

@item
Many minibuffer functions, such as @code{read-file-name} and
@code{minibuffer-complete}, have been rewritten in C.  The completion
code has been considerably simplified; for instance, the completion
style cannot be changed via @code{completion-styles-alist}, and
@code{completing-read} no longer recognizes the special values
@code{confirm-only} and @code{confirm-after-completion} for its
@var{require-match} argument.

@item
Explicitly numbered groups in regular expressions are no longer
supported.

@item
Faces can no longer be remapped.

@item
Fonts are no longer represented using a special set of ``font'' data
types.  Lisp programs may only specify fonts by name, as strings
following the XLFD (X logical font descriptor) format.

@item
Display terminals are no longer represented using a ``terminal'' data
type.  This data type is not necessary, because Emacs can no longer
display on graphical and text-only terminals simultaneously.  For the
same reason, the @code{window-system} variable is no longer
frame-local, and the @code{window-system} function has been removed.

@item
The functions @code{list-system-processes} and
@code{process-attributes} have been removed.  To get information about
system processes, call an external program, such as @command{ps}.

@item
Variables can now be both buffer-local and frame-local; buffer-local
bindings take precedence over frame-local bindings.

@item
Windows no longer have parameters.

@item
The function @code{locate-user-emacs-file} and the variable
@code{user-emacs-directory} have been removed.  Programs can instead
use hard-coded values pointing to @file{~/.emacs.d}.

@item
@code{vertical-motion} can no longer be told to move to a specific
column; it always puts point on the first column of a line.

@item
Emacs no longer recognizes the @code{permanent-local-hook} property of
local hook functions.

@item
The @code{ignore-errors} macro has been moved into the @code{cl}
package.

@item
The @code{mode-name} variable now accepts only string values, and
cannot take the form of a mode-line construct.

@item
Several keymap have been eliminated: @code{input-decode-map},
@code{local-function-key-map}, @code{search-map},
@code{multi-query-replace-map}, and
@code{minibuffer-local-shell-command-map}.

@item
Many functions have been removed, including @code{emacs-init-time},
@code{emacs-uptime}, @code{buffer-swap-text}, @code{use-region-p} and
@code{region-active-p}, @code{start-file-process},
@code{process-lines}, @code{image-refresh},
@code{match-substitute-replacement}, @code{word-search-forward-lax},
and @code{word-search-backward-lax}.

@item
Many variables have been removed, including @code{read-circle},
@code{before-init-time} and @code{after-init-time},
@code{generate-autoload-cookie}, @code{file-local-variables-alist},
@code{replace-search-function} and @code{replace-re-search-function},
@code{inhibit-changing-match-data}, @code{wrap-prefix} and
@code{line-prefix},
