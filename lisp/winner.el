;;; Commentary:
;; 
;;   Winner.el provides a minor mode (`winner-mode') that does
;;   essentially two things:
;;
;;     1) It keeps track of changing window configurations, so that
;;        when you wish to go back to a previous view, all you have
;;        to do is to press C-left a couple of times.
;;
;;     2) It lets you switch to other buffers by pressing C-right.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;;   1. Put this file in a directory on your (emacs) load-path
;;   2. Byte-compile the file (eg. with M-x byte-compile-file)
;;   3. Put these two lines in your .emacs - file:
;;
;;      (autoload 'winner-mode "winner" "Toggle Winner mode." t)
;;      (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda () (winner-mode 1)))
;;
;;   4. Restart emacs for changes to take effect.
;;
;;   (This version of) Winner will only run properly
;;   on Emacs-19.35 or newer.
;;

;; Details:
;;
;;   1. You may of course decide to use other bindings than those
;;      mentioned above.  Just set these variables in your .emacs:
;;
;;          `winner-prev-event'
;;          `winner-next-event'
;;
;;   2. When you have found the view of  your choice
;;      (using your favourite keys), you may press ctrl-space
;;      (`winner-max-event') to `delete-other-windows'.
;;
;;   3. Winner now keeps one configuration stack for each frame.
;;

;;                           Yours sincerely,   Ivar Rummelhoff
