;;; Commentary:

;;; This code defines a ring data structure. A ring is a 
;;;     (hd-index tl-index . vector) 
;;; list. You can insert to, remove from, and rotate a ring. When the ring
;;; fills up, insertions cause the oldest elts to be quietly dropped.
;;;
;;; HEAD = index of the newest item on the ring.
;;; TAIL = index of the oldest item on the ring.
;;;
;;; These functions are used by the input history mechanism, but they can
;;; be used for other purposes as well.

;;; Code:
