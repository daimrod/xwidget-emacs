;;; Commentary:

;; The ancestral gdb.el was by W. Schelter <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>
;; It was later rewritten by rms.  Some ideas were due to Masanobu. 
;; Grand Unification (sdb/dbx support) by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
;; The overloading code was then rewritten by Barry Warsaw <bwarsaw@cen.com>,
;; who also hacked the mode to use comint.el.

;; Note: use of this package with sdb requires that your tags.el support
;; the find-tag-noselect entry point.  Stock distributions up to 18.57 do 
;; *not* include this feature; if it's not included with this file, email
;; esr@snark.thyrsus.com for it or get 18.58.

;; Further note: due to lossage in the Emacs-18 byte compiler, compiled
;; versions of this code will fail with a complaint about gud-step if
;; you invoke the gdb or sdb initializers.  This should be fixed in 19.

;; This macro is used below to define some basic debugger interface commands.
;; Of course you may use `gud-def' with any other debugger command, including
;; user defined ones.

;; A macro call like (gud-def FUNC NAME KEY DOC) expands to a form
;; which defines FUNC to send the command NAME to the debugger, gives
;; it the docstring DOC, and binds that function to KEY.  NAME should
;; be a string.  If a numeric prefix argument is given to FUNC, it
;; gets sent after NAME.

;; All debugger-specific information is collected here
;; Here's how it works, in case you ever need to add a debugger to the table.
;;
;; Each entry must define the following at startup:
;;
;;<name>
;; comint-prompt-regexp
;; gud-<name>-debugger-startup
;; gud-<name>-marker-filter
;; gud-<name>-visit-file
;; gud-<name>-set-break
;;
;; The job of the startup-command method is to fire up a copy of the debugger,
;; given an object file and source directory.
;;
;; The job of the marker-filter method is to detect file/line markers in
;; strings and set the global gud-last-frame to indicate what display
;; action (if any) should be triggered by the marker.  Note that only
;; whetever the method *returns* is displayed in the buffer; thus, you
;; can filter the debugger's output, interpreting some and passing on
;; the rest.
;;
;; The job of the visit-file method is to visit and return the buffer indicated
;; by the car of gud-tag-frame.  This may be a file name, a tag name, or
;; something else.
;;
;; The job of the gud-set-break method is to send the commands necessary
;; to set a breakpoint at a given line in a given source file.
;;
;; Debugger-specific information begins here:

  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior debugger process.

   You start it up with one of the commands M-x gdb, M-x sdb, or
M-x dbx.  Each entry point finishes by executing a hook; gdb-mode-hook,
sdb-mode-hook or dbx-mode-hook respectively.

After startup, the following commands are available:

\\{gud-mode-map}

\\[gud-refresh] displays in the other window the last line referred to
in the gud buffer.

\\[gud-step], \\[gud-next], and \\[gud-stepi] in the gud window,
do a step-one-line, step-one-line (not entering function calls), and 
step-one-instruction and then update the other window
with the current file and position.  \\[gud-cont] continues
execution.

The above commands are common to all supported debuggers.  If you are
using gdb or dbx, the following additional commands will be available:

\\[gud-up] pops up through an enclosing stack frame.  \\[gud-down] drops
back down through one.

If you are using gdb, \\[gdb-finish] runs execution to the return from
the current function and stops.

These functions repeat themselves the appropriate number of times if you give a
prefix argument.

If you are in a source file, you may do the following:

Set a breakpoint at the current line by doing \\[gud-break].  This causes
an appropriate set-break to be send to the debugger; of course, if the file
you're visiting doesn't correspond to any code in the executable this will
have no effect or raise an error.

Execute a user-defined command at point with \\[send-gud-command]; the
prefix argument is taken as an index into the list of strings gud-commands.
A %s in a gud-commands string is substituted with a number or address picked
up from point.

Other commands for interacting with the debugger process are inherited from
comint mode, which see."
