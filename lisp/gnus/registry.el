;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a general-purpose EIEIO-based registry
;; database with persistence, initialized with these fields:

;; version: a float, 0.1 currently (don't change it)

;; max-hard: an integer, default 5000000

;; max-soft: an integer, default 50000

;; precious: a list of symbols

;; tracked: a list of symbols

;; tracker: a hashtable tuned for 100 symbols to track (you should
;; only access this with the :lookup2-function and the
;; :lookup2+-function)

;; data: a hashtable with default size 10K and resize threshold 2.0
;; (this reflects the expected usage so override it if you know better)

;; ...plus methods to do all the work: `registry-search',
;; `registry-lookup', `registry-lookup-secondary',
;; `registry-lookup-secondary-value', `registry-insert',
;; `registry-delete', `registry-prune', `registry-size' which see

;; and with the following properties:

;; Every piece of data has a unique ID and some general-purpose fields
;; (F1=D1, F2=D2, F3=(a b c)...) expressed as an alist, e.g.

;; ((F1 D1) (F2 D2) (F3 a b c))

;; Note that whether a field has one or many pieces of data, the data
;; is always a list of values.

;; The user decides which fields are "precious", F2 for example.  At
;; PRUNE TIME (when the :prune-function is called), the registry will
;; trim any entries without the F2 field until the size is :max-soft
;; or less.  No entries with the F2 field will be removed at PRUNE
;; TIME.

;; When an entry is inserted, the registry will reject new entries
;; if they bring it over the max-hard limit, even if they have the F2
;; field.

;; The user decides which fields are "tracked", F1 for example.  Any
;; new entry is then indexed by all the tracked fields so it can be
;; quickly looked up that way.  The data is always a list (see example
;; above) and each list element is indexed.

;; Precious and tracked field names must be symbols.  All other
;; fields can be any other Emacs Lisp types.
