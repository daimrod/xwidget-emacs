will get the same value of point as the current window.  This is often
more convenient for editing.

Otherwise, we chose window starts so as to minimize the amount of
redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.  The new selected
window is the one that the current value of point appears in.  The
value of point can change if the text around point is hidden by the
