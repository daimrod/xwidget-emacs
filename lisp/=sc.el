;; sc.el -- Version 2.3 (used to be supercite.el)

;; ========== Introduction ==========
;; Citation and attribution package for various GNU emacs news and
;; electronic mail reading subsystems.  This version of supercite will
;; interface to VM 4.40+ and MH-E 3.7 (shipped w/ emacs 18.57) as is.
;; It will also interface with GNUS 3.12+, RMAIL 18.55+, GNEWS, and
;; probably most other news/mail subsystems by using the overloading
;; functions provided in sc-oloads.el (see that file or the README for
;; more information on interfacing supercite with your reader subsystem).
;; This version should now be compatible with Lucid Emacs 19.x emacses.

;; This package does not do any yanking of messages, but instead
;; massages raw reply buffers set up by the reply/forward functions in
;; the news/mail subsystems. Therefore, such useful operations as
;; yanking and citing portions of the original article (instead of the
;; whole article) are not within the ability or responsibility of
;; supercite.

;; ========== Disclaimer ==========
;; This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
;; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  No author or distributor, nor any
;; author's past, present, or future employers accepts responsibility
;; to anyone for the consequences of using it or for whether it serves
;; any particular purpose or works at all, unless he says so in
;; writing.

;; Some of this software was written as part of the supercite author's
;; official duty as an employee of the United States Government and is
;; thus not subject to copyright.  You are free to use that particular
;; software as you wish, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.  It
;; would be nice, though if when you use any of this or other freely
;; available code, you give due credit to the author.

;; Other parts of this code were written by other people.  Wherever
;; possible, credit to that author, and the copy* notice supplied by
;; the author are included with that code. The supercite author is no
;; longer an employee of the U.S. Government so the GNU Public Licence

;; ========== Credits and Thanks ==========
;; This package was derived from the Superyank 1.11 package as posted
;; to the net.  Superyank 1.11 was inspired by code and ideas from
;; Martin Neitzel and Ashwin Ram.  Supercite version 2.3 has evolved
;; through the comments and suggestions of the supercite mailing list
;; which consists of many authors and users of the various mail and
;; news reading subsystems.

;; Many folks on the supercite mailing list have contributed their
;; help in debugging, making suggestions and supplying support code or
;; bug fixes for the previous versions of supercite.  I want to thank
;; everyone who helped, especially (in no particular order):
;;
;; Mark D. Baushke, Khalid Sattar, David Lawrence, Chris Davis, Kyle
;; Jones, Kayvan Sylvan, Masanobu Umeda, Dan Jacobson, Piet van
;; Oostrum, Hamish (H.I.) Macdonald, and Joe Wells.
;;
;; I don't mean to leave anyone out. All who have helped have been
;; appreciated.

;; ========== Getting Started ==========
;; Here is a quick guide to getting started with supercite. The
;; information contained here is mostly excerpted from the more
;; detailed explanations given in the accompanying README file.
;; Naturally, there are many customizations you can do to give your
;; replies that personalized flair, but the instructions in this
;; section should be sufficient for getting started.

;; With this release of supercite overloading is the only supported
;; way to get supercite hooked into your favorite news/mail reading
;; subsystems.  Overloading will be necessary for RMAIL, GNUS, GNEWS,
;; RNEWS and PCMAIL. Overloading will not be needed for VM 4.37+ or
;; MH-E 3.7+.  MH-E comes with emacs 18.57 but if you have an earlier
;; version of emacs, you should be able to ftp MH-E 3.7 separately. Or
;; you can extract the MH-E overloading stuff from version 2.1's
;; sc-oloads.el.

;; First, to connect supercite to any mail/news reading subsystem, put
;; this in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (add-hooks 'mail-yank-hooks 'sc-cite-original)  ; for all but MH-E
;; (setq mh-yank-hooks   'sc-cite-original)  ; for MH-E only
;;
;; If supercite is not pre-loaded into your emacs session, you should
;; add the following autoload:
;;
;; (autoload 'sc-cite-original "sc" "Supercite 2.3" t)
;;
;; Then, if you need to overload, put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (defun my-sc-overload-hook ()
;;   (require 'sc-oloads)      ; be sure this file is on your load-path
;;   (sc-overload-functions))
;;
;; (setq news-reply-mode-hook 'my-sc-overload-hook) ; for RNEWS,GNUS,GNEWS
;; (setq mail-setup-hook      'my-sc-overload-hook) ; for RMAIL, PCMAIL
;;
;; Finally, if you want to customize supercite, you should do it in a
;; function called my-supercite-hook and:
;;
;; (setq sc-load-hook 'my-supercite-hook)

(require 'sc-alist)
