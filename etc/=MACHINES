This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.

For each system and machine, we give the configuration name you should
pass to the `configure' script to prepare to build Emacs for that
system/machine.

The `configure' script uses the configuration name to decide which
machine and operating system description files `src/config.h' should
include.  The machine description files are all in `src/m', and have
names similar to, but not identical to, the machine names used in
configuration names.  The operating system files are all in `src/s',
and are named similarly.  See the `configure' script if you need to
know which configuration names use which machine and operating system
description files.

If you add support for a new configuration, add a section to this
file, and then edit the `configure' script to tell it which
configuration name(s) should select your new machine description and
system description files.


Here are the configurations Emacs is intended to work with, with the
corresponding configuration names.  You can postpend version numbers
to operating system names (i.e. sunos4.1) or architecture names (i.e.
hppa1.1).  If you leave out the version number, the `configure' script
will configure Emacs for the latest version it knows about.

Alliant (fx80-alliant-bsd):

  18.52 worked on system version 4.  Previous Emacs versions were
  known to work on previous system versions.

  If you are using older versions of their operating system, you may
  need to edit `src/config.h' to use `m/alliant1.h' (on version 1) or
  `m/alliant.h' (on versions 2 and 3).

Alliant FX/2800 (i860-alliant-bsd)

  Known to work with 18.58 and OS version 2.2, compiler version 1.3.

Altos 3068 (m68k-altos-sysv)

  18.52 was said to work, provided you don't compile unexec.c with -O.

Amdahl UTS (580-amdahl-sysv)

  Small changes for 18.38 were merged in 18.39.  It is mostly
  working, but at last report a bug sometimes causes Emacs to
  grab very large amounts of memory.  No fix or explanation
  has yet been reported.  It may be possible to find this bug
  if you find which Emacs command it happens within and then
  run that command with a breakpoint set at malloc.

  The 5.2u370 compiler is so brain damaged that it is not
  even worth trying to use it.  Success was obtained with the
  uts native C compiler on uts version 5.2.5.

Apollo running Domain (m68k-apollo-bsd)

  18.52 works, to some extent.
  Code for dumping Emacs has been written, but we cannot distribute it yet.
  There are reports of bugs in cc -O on this system.

  In `lib-src/Makefile', don't expect emacsclient and emacsserver to
  compile.  You might want to remove them from your makefile.

  Supposedly something in dired.c runs into a compiler bug.
  Paraphrasing the statement should avoid the problem.  I have not yet
  received word as to the exact statement this is.

  The Apollo has a bizarre operating system which does not permit
  Emacs to be dumped with preloaded pure Lisp code.  Therefore, each
  time you start Emacs on this system, the standard Lisp code is loaded
  into it.  Expect it to take a long time.  You can prevent loading of
  the standard Lisp code by specifying the -nl switch.  It must
  come at the beginning of the command line; only the -t and -batch
  switches may come before it.

  There is one remaining problem on the Apollo.  You must replace
  the CPP line in src/Makefile with "CPP = /usr/lib/cpp".
  The C preprocessor lives there rather than in /lib/cpp because the
  Aegis OS uses the /lib directory as the repository for shared libraries.


  Here is a design for a method of dumping and reloading the relevant
  necessary impure areas of Emacs.

  On dumping, you need to dump only the array `pure' plus the
  locations that contain values of forwarded Lisp variables or that are
  protected for garbage collection.  The former can be found by a
  garbage- collection-like technique, and the latter are in the
  staticprolist vector (see alloc.c for both things).

  Reloading would work in an Emacs that has just been started; except
  when a switch is specified to inhibit this, it would read the dump
  file and set all the appropriate locations.  The data loaded must be
  relocated, but that's not hard.  Those locations that are of type
  Lisp_Object can be found by a technique like garbage-collection, and
  those of them that point to storage can be relocated.  The other data
  read from the file will not need to be relocated.

  The switch to inhibit loading the data base would be used when it
  is time to dump a new data base.

  This would take a few seconds, which is much faster than loading
  the Lisp code of Emacs from scratch.

AT&T 3b2, 3b5, 3b15, 3b20 (we32k-att-sysv)

  Emacs will probably not work with certain kernel constants too small. 

  In param.h CDLIMIT should be at least (1L << 12) in order to allow 
  processes to write up to 2 Mbyte files.  This parameter is configurable
  by normal means in /etc/master.d/kernel; examine that file for the
  symbol CDLIMIT or ULIMIT, and raise it by several powers of 2.  Then
  do normal kernel rebuild things via "cd /boot; mkboot -k KERNEL" and so
  forth.

  In seg.h NSEGP and STACKSEG should be at least 16 and 4 respectively
  to allow processes with total size of up to 2Mbytes.
  However, I'm told it is unlikely this would fail to be true.

  The MAXMEM may also prevent Emacs from running.  The file
  3B-MAXMEM in this directory explains how to increase MAXMEM.

AT&T 7300 or 3b1 (m68k-att-sysv)

  18.52 worked.  If you have strange troubles with dumping
  Emacs, delete the last few lines from `src/m/7300.h' and recompile.
  These lines are supposed to produce a sharable executable.

  `src/m/7300.h' defines SHORTNAMES because operating system versions
  older than 3.5 did not support long symbol names.  Version 3.5 does
  support them, so you can remove the #define SHORTNAMES in that
  version.

Bull sps7 (m68k-bull-sysv)

  Changes partially merged in version 19, but some fixes are probably required.

CCI 5/32, 6/32

  See "Tahoe".

Celerity (celerity-celerity-bsd4.2)

  Version 18.49 worked.  This configuration name is a hack, because we
  don't know the processor used by Celerities.  If someone
  who uses a Celerity could get in touch with us, we can teach
  config.sub a better name for the configuration.

Clipper (clipper-???)

  Version 19 has support for some brand of clipper system.  If you
  have successfully built Emacs 19 on some sort of clipper system, let
  us know so we can flesh out this entry.

  Note that the Orion 105 is also a clipper, but some system-related
  parameters are different.

Convex (c1-convex-bsd, c2-convex-bsd, c32-convex-bsd, c34-convex-bsd,
        c38-convex-bsd)

  18.53 supposedly to work.

Cubix QBx/386 (i386-cubix-sysv)

  Changes merged in 19.1.  Systems before 2/A/0 may fail to compile etags.c
  due to a compiler bug.

Cydra 5 (cydra-cydrome-sysv)

  18.51 worked in one version of their operating system but stopped
  working in a newer version.  This has not been fixed.

DECstation (mips-dec-ultrix or mips-dec-osf)

  Version 19 works under Ultrix.

  See under Ultrix for problems using X windows on Ultrix.
  Note that this is a MIPS machine.

  For Ultrix versions 4.1 or earlier, you may need to define
  SYSTEM_MALLOC in `src/m/pmax.h', because XvmsAlloc.o in libX11.a seems
  to insist on defining malloc itself.

  For Ultrix versions prior to 4.0, you may need to delete
  the definition of START_FILES from `src/m/pmax.h'.

Motorola Delta 147 (m68k-motorola-sysv)

  Motorola Delta boxes running System V/68 release 3.
  (tested on sys1147 with SVR3V5).  Changes merged in 19.1.

Motorola Delta 187 (m88k-motorola-sysv or m88k-motorola-m88kbcs)

  Machine support added in version 19.
  HAVE_X_MENU does not work due to lack of insque.
 
Dual running System V (m68k-dual-sysv)

  As of 17.46, this worked except for a few changes
  needed in unexec.c.

Dual running Uniplus (m68k-dual-uniplus)

  Worked, as of 17.51.

Elxsi 6400 (elxsi-elxsi-sysv)

  Changes for 12.0 release are in 19.1.
  Dumping should work now.

Encore machine (ns16k-encore-bsd)

  This machine bizarrely uses 4.2BSD modified to use the COFF format
  for object files.  Works (as of 18.40).  For the APC processor you
  must enable two lines at the end of `src/s/umax.h', which are commented
  out in the file as distributed.

  WARNING: If you compile Emacs with the "-O" compiler switch, you
  must also use the "-q enter_exits" switch so that all functions have
  stack frames.  Otherwise routines that call `alloca' all lose.

  A kernel bug in some system versions causes input characters to be lost
  occasionally.

GEC 63 (local-gec63-usg5.2)

  Changes are partially merged in version 18, but certainly require
  more work.  Let us know if you get this working, and we'll give it a
  real configuration name.

Gould Power Node (pn-gould-bsd4.2 or pn-gould-bsd4.3)

  18.36 worked on versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the operating system.

  On UTX/32 2.0, use pn-gould-bsd4.3.

  On UTX/32 1.2 and UTX/32S 1.0, use pn-gould-bsd4.2 and note that
  compiling `lib-src/sorted-doc' tickles a compiler bug: remove the -g
  flag to cc in the makefile.

  UTX/32 1.3 has a bug in the bcopy library routine.  Fix it by 
  #undef BSTRING in `src/m/gould.h'.

  Version 19 incorporates support for releases 2.1 and later of UTX/32.
  A site running a pre-release of 2.1 should #define RELEASE2_1 in config.h.

Gould NP1 (np1-gould-bsd)

  Version 19 supposedly works.

Honeywell XPS100 (xps100-honeywell-sysv)

  Config file added in version 19.

HP 9000 series 200 or 300 (m68k-hp-bsd or m68k-hp-hpux7.)

  Version 19 works under BSD.

  These machines are 68000-series CPUs running HP-UX
  (a derivative of sysV with some BSD features) or BSD 4.3 ported by Utah.
  The operating system suffix determines which system Emacs is built for.

  Series 200 HPUX runs Emacs only if it has the "HP-UX upgrade".

  If you are running HP-UX release 8.0 or later, you need the optional
  "C/ANSI C" software in order to build Emacs (older releases of HP-UX
  do not require any special software).  If the file "/etc/filesets/C"
  exists on your machine, you have this software, otherwise you do not.

  Note that HP has used two incompatible assembler syntaxes,
  and has recently changed the format of C function frames.
  `src/crt0.c' and `src/alloca.s' have been conditionalised for the new
  assembler and new function-entry sequence.  You may need to define
  OLD_HP_ASSEMBLER if you are using an older hpux version.  If you
  have an official (bought from HP) series 300 machine you have
  the new assembler.  Kernels that are 5.+ or later have new
  assembler.  A Series 200 that has been upgraded to a 68010
  processor and a 5.+ kernel has the new compiler.

  Define C_SWITCH_MACHINE to be +X to make a version of Emacs that
  runs on both 68010 and 68020 based hp-ux's.

  Define HPUX_68010 if you are using the new assembler, for
  a system that has a 68010 without a 68881.  This is to say,
  a s200 (upgraded) or s310.

  Define the symbol HPUX_NET if you have the optional network features
  that include the `netunam' system call.  This is refered to as
  Network Services (NS/9000) in HP literature.

HP 9000 series 500: not supported.

  The series 500 has a seriously incompatible memory architecture
  which relocates data in memory during execution of a program,
  and support for it would be difficult to implement.

HP 9000 series 800 (Spectrum) (hppa1.0-hp-hpux)

  These files support HP's Precision Architecture machines
  running HP-UX.  It has been moderately tested on the Series
  840.

  If you are running HP-UX release 8.0 or later, you need the optional
  "C/ANSI C" software in order to build Emacs (older releases of HP-UX
  do not require any special software).  If the file "/etc/filesets/C"
  exists on your machine, you have this software, otherwise you do not.

High Level Hardware Orion (orion-highlevel-bsd)

  This is the original microprogrammed hardware.
  Machine description file ought to work.

High Level Hardware Orion 1/05 (clipper-highlevel-bsd)

  Changes merged in 18.52.  This is the one with the Clipper cpu.
  Note that systems which lack NFS need LOAD_AVE_TYPE changed to `double'.

  C compiler has a bug; it loops compiling eval.c.
  Compile it by hand without optimization.

IBM PS/2 (i386-ibm-aix1.1 or i386-ibm-aix1.2)

  Changes merged in version 19.  You may need to copy
  /usr/lib/samples/hft/hftctl.c to the Emacs src directory.

  i386-ibm-aix1.1 may not work with certain new X window managers, and
  may be suboptimal.

IBM RS/6000 (rs6000-ibm-aix)

  Changes merged in version 19.  Currently the configuration
  does not actually depend on the version of AIX.

  Compiling with -O using the IBM compiler has been known
  to make Emacs work incorrectly.

IBM RT/PC (romp-ibm-bsd or romp-ibm-aix)

  18.52 worked on both operating systems.
  Use romp-ibm-bsd for the 4.2-like system and romp-ibm-aix for AIX.

  On BSD, if you have trouble, try compiling with a different compiler.

  On AIX, the file /usr/lib/samples/hft/hftctl.c must be compiled into
  hftctl.o, with this result left in the src directory (hftctl.c is
  part of the standard AIX distribution).

  window.c must not be compiled with -O on AIX.

Integrated Solutions `Optimum V' (m68k-isi-bsd4.2 or -bsd4.3)

  18.52 said to work on some sort of ISI machine.
  Version 18.45 worked (running on a Optimum V (VME bus, 68020)
  BSD 4.2 (3.05e) system).  18.42 is reported to work on
  a Qbus 68010 system.  Has not been tried on `WorkStation' `Cluster
  Compute Node' `Cluster WorkStation' or `Server Node'  (Love the
  StudLYCaps) 

  Compilation with -O is rumored to break something.

  On recent system versions, you may need to undefine the macro UMAX
  in `lib-src/loadst.c' and `src/getpagesize.h'.  They stupidly defined this
  in a system header file, which confuses Emacs (which thinks that UMAX
  indicates the Umax operating system).

Intel 386 (i386-unknown-isc, i386-unknown-esix, i386-unknown-xenix,
	   i386-intsys-sysv, i386-unknown-sysv5.2.2, i386-unknown-sysv5.3,
	   and i386-unknown-bsd4.2)

  18.58 should support a wide variety of operating systems.
  Make sure to use i386-unknown-isc2.2 for Interactive 386/ix version
	2.2 or later.
  Use i386-unknown-esix for Esix.
  Use i386-intsys-sysv for Integrated Solutions 386 machines.
  It may also be correct for Microport systems.
  It isn't clear what to do on an SCO system.  The system's C
  preprocessor doesn't seem to handle the src subdirectory's Make
  trickery, so you will probably need to install the GNU C preprocessor.

  If you are using Xenix, see notes above under Xenix.

  Some sysV.3 systems seem to have bugs in `opendir';
  for them, alter `config.h' to define NONSYSTEM_DIR_LIBRARY
  and undefine SYSV_SYSTEM_DIR.

  If you use optimization on V.3, you may need the option -W2,'-y 0'
  to prevent certain faulty optimization.

  On 386/ix, to link with shared libraries, add #define USG_SHARED_LIBRARIES
  to config.h.

  There is no consistency in the handling of certain system header files
  on V.3.

  Some versions have sys/sioctl.h, and require it in sysdep.c.
  But some versions do not have sys/sioctl.h.
  For a given version of the system, this may depend on whether you have
  X Windows or TCP/IP.  Define or undefine NO_SIOCTL_H in config.h
  according to whether you have the file.

  Likewise, some versions have been known to need sys/ttold.h, sys/stream.h,
  and sys/ptem.h included in sysdep.c.  If your system has these files,
  try defining NEED_PTEM_H in config.h if you have trouble without it.

  You may find that adding -I/usr/X/include or -I/usr/netinclude or both
  to CFLAGS avoids compilation errors on certain systems.

  Some versions convince sysdep.c to try to use `struct tchars'
  but define `struct tc' instead; add `#define tchars tc'
  to config.h to solve this problem.

Iris 2500 and Iris 2500 Turbo (m68k-sgi-iris3.5 or m68k-sgi-iris3.6)

  Version 18 was said to work; use m68k-sgi-iris3.5 for system version 2.5
  and m68k-sgi-iris3.6 for system version 3.6.
  Note that the 3030 is the same as the Iris 2500 Turbo.

Iris 4D (mips-sgi-irix3.3 or mips-sgi-irix4.0)

  18.58 is known to work on Silicon Graphics 4D series machines
  with IRIX 3.3 or IRIX 4.0.  Version 19 should support the
  ANSI C compiler version 3.10.

  Most irix3.3 systems do not have an ANSI C compiler, but a few do.
  If you are using the ANSI C compiler, you may need to add
      #define C_SWITCH_MACHINE -cckr
  to config.h.

  There is a bug in IRIX that can sometimes leave ptys owned by
  root with a permission of 622.  This causes malfunctions in use
  of subprocesses of Emacs.  This may be fixed in IRIX 4.0.5.

Macintosh

  We are boycotting Apple because of Apple's efforts to take away
  our freedom to write compatible imitations of existing software.
  If you value your freedom to write such programs, we urge you
  not to buy from Apple, not to develop software for Apple, and
  certainly not to accept a job with Apple.

  See the file APPLE in this directory for more information.

Masscomp (m68k-masscomp-rtu)

  18.36 worked on a 5500DP running RTU v3.1a and compiler version 3.2
  with minor fixes that are included in 18.37.  However, bizarre behavior
  was reported for 18.36 on a Masscomp (model and version unknown but probably
  a 68020 system).  The report sounds like a compiler bug.

  A compiler bug affecting statements like 
    unsigned char k; unsigned char *p;... x = p[k];
  has been reported for "C version 1.2 under RTU 3.1".  We do not wish
  to take the time to install the numerous workarounds required to
  compensate for this bug; go complain to Masscomp.

  For RTU version 3.1, define FIRST_PTY_LETTER to be 'p' in `src/s/rtu.h'
  (or #undef and redefine it in config.h) so that ptys will be used.

  GNU Emacs is said to have no chance of compiling on RTU versions
  prior to v3.0.

Megatest (m68k-megatest-bsd)

  Emacs 15 worked; do not have any reports about Emacs 16 or 17
  but any new bugs are probably not difficult.

Mips (mips-mips-riscos, mips-mips-riscos4.0, or mips-mips-bsd)

  Changes merged in 18.39.  Some fixes in 18.56.

  Use mips-mips-riscos4.0 for RISCOS version 4.
  Use mips-mips-bsd with the BSD world.

  Note that the proper configuration names for DECstations are
  mips-dec-ultrix and mips-dec-osf.

  If you are compiling with GCC, then you must run fixincludes;
  the alternative of using -traditional won't work because
  the definition of SIGN_EXTEND_CHAR uses the keyword `signed'.

  If the SYSV world is the default, then you probably need the following
  line in etc/Makefile:

    CFLAGS= -g -systype bsd43

  Some operating systems on MIPS machines give SIGTRAP for division by
  zero instead of the usual signals.  The only real solution is to fix
  the system to give a proper signal.

  In the meantime, you can change init_data in data.c if you wish.
  Change it to handle SIGTRAP as well as SIGFPE.  But this will have a
  great disadvantage: you will not be able to run Emacs under a
  debugger.  I think crashing on division by zero is a lesser problem.

National Semiconductor 32000 (ns32k-ns-genix)

  This is for a complete machine from National Semiconductor,
  running Genix.  Changes merged in version 19.

NCR Tower 32 (m68k-ncr-sysv2 or m68k-ncr-sysv3)

  If you are running System V release 2, use m68k-ncr-sysv2.
  If you are running System V release 3, use m68k-ncr-sysv3.

  These both worked as of 18.56.  If you change `src/ymakefile' so that
  CFLAGS includes C_OPTIMIZE_SWITCH rather than C_DEBUG_SWITCH, check
  out the comments in `src/m/tower32.h' (for System V release 2) or
  `src/m/tower32v3.h' (for System V release 3) about this.

  There is a report that compilation with -O did not work with 18.54
  under System V release 2.

Nixdorf Targon 31 (m68k-nixdorf-sysv)

  Machine description file for version 17 is included in 18
  but whether it works is not known.
  `src/unexec.c' bombs if compiled with -O.
  Note that the "Targon 35" is really a Pyramid.

Nu (TI or LMI) (m68k-nu-sysv)

  Version 18 is believed to work.

Plexus (m68k-plexus-sysv)

  Worked as of 17.56.

Pmax (DEC Mips)  (mips-dec-ultrix or mips-dec-osf1)

  See under DECstation, above.

Prime EXL (i386-prime-sysv)

  Minor changes merged in 19.1.

Pyramid (pyramid-pyramid-bsd)

  You need to build Emacs in the Berkeley universe with
  the `ucb' command, as in `ucb make' or `ucb build-install'.
  
  In OSx 4.0, it seems necessary to add the following two lines
  to `src/m/pyramid.h':
     #define _longjmp longjmp
     #define _setjmp setjmp

  In Pyramid system 2.5 there has been a compiler bug making
  Emacs crash just after screen-splitting with Qnil containing 0.
  A compiler that fixes this is Pyramid customer number 8494,
  internal number 1923.

  Some versions of the pyramid compiler get fatal
  errors when the -gx compiler switch is used; if this
  happens to you, change `src/m/pyramid.h' to define
  C_DEBUG_SWITCH with an empty definition.

  Some old system versions may require you to define PYRAMID_OLD
  in when alloca.s is preprocessed, in order to define _longjmp and _setjmp.

Sequent Balance (ns32k-sequent-bsd4.2 or ns32k-sequent-bsd4.3)

  Emacs 18.51 worked on system version 3.0.  18.52 is said to work.
  Delete some lines at the end of `src/m/sequent.h' for earlier system
  versions.

Sequent Symmetry (i386-sequent-bsd)

  Emacs 19 should work.

SONY News (m68k-sony-bsd4.2 or m68k-sony-bsd4.3)

  18.52 worked.  Use m68k-sony-bsd4.3 for system release 3.

SONY News 3000 series (RISC NEWS) (mips-sony-bsd)

  Worked, as of 18.56.  Note that this is a MIPS architecture machine.

  Some versions of the operating system give SIGTRAP for division by zero
  instead of the usual signals.  This causes division by zero
  to make Emacs crash.  The system should be fixed to give the proper signal.
  Changing Emacs is not a proper solution, because it would prevent
  Emacs from working under any debugger.  But you can change init_data
  in data.c if you wish.

Stardent 1500 or 3000

  See Titan.

Stride (m68k-stride-sysv)

  Works (most recent news for 18.30) on their release 2.0.
  For release 2.2, see the end of `src/m/stride.h'.
  It may be possible to run on their V.1 system but changes
  in the s- file would be needed.

Sun 1, 2 and 3 (m68k-sun-sunos, sparc-sun-sunos, i386-sun-sunos)

  It's important to include the SunOS version number in the
  configuration name.  For example, for SunOS release 4.0 on a Sun 3,
  use `m68k-sun-sunos4.0'; for SunOS release 4.1 on a Sparc, use
  `sparc-sun-sunos4.1'.

  Use `m68k' for the 68000-based Sun boxes, `sparc' for Sparcstations,
  and `i386' for Sun Roadrunners.

  There are three machine files for the different versions of SunOS
  that run on the Motorola 68000 processors.  All are derived from
  Berkeley 4.2.  Emacs 17 has run on all of them.

  See the file etc/SUNBUG for how to solve problems caused by
  bugs in the "export" version of SunOS 4.

  If you have trouble using open-network-stream, get the
  distribution of `bind' (the BSD name-server), build libresolv.a,
  and link Emacs with -lresolv.  This problem is due to obsolete
  software in the nonshared standard library.

  If you want to use SunWindows, define HAVE_SUN_WINDOWS
  in config.h to enable a special interface called `emacstool'.
  The definition must *precede* the #include "machine.h".
  System version 3.2 is required for this facility to work.

  We recommend that you instead use the X window system, which
  has technical advantages, is an industry standard, and is also
  free software.

  If you are compiling for X windows, and the X window library was
  compiled to use the 68881, then you must edit config.h according
  the comments at the end of `src/m/sun3.h'.

  Note that Emacs on a Sun is not really as big as it looks.
  As dumped, it includes around 200k of zeros between the
  original text section and the original data section
  (now remapped as part of the text).  These are never
  swapped in.

  To build a single Emacs that will run on Sun 2 and Sun 3
  HARDWARE, just build it on the Sun 2.

  Changes for the Sparc architecture were merged in 18.50.  Some
  people say optimizing compilation does not work; some say that -O2
  (whatever that is) works perhaps with a small change.

  Changes for the Roadrunner architecture were merged in 18.51.

  There is a bug in the Export version of SunOS 4.0 shipped outsde the
  US; it has something to do with Pentagon export restrictions on the
  DES chips in Suns.  The symptom is that "cc -Bstatic ..." WILL NOT
  WORK ON SUNOS 4.0 EXPORT without a little help from "ar".  The
  static C-library is /lib/libc.a, and this is where the problem
  occurs.  There are a bunch of .o files in there relating to DES
  stuff (des_crypt.o, des_soft.o, _crypt.o, etc).  All of them will
  cause cc -Bstatic to die with these errors:

  > _edata: ld: user attempt to redefine loader-defined symbol
  > _end: user attempt to redefine loader-defined symbol
  > _etext: /lib/libc.a(des_crypt.o): multiply defined

  In order to make cc -Bstatic useful, you must remove all the
  brain-damaged .o files from /lib/libc.a.  To do this use

  ar d /lib/libc.a des_crypt.o des_soft.o _crypt.o ....

  (Make a backup of /lib/libc.a first, you may decide you need the "real"
  thing someday).  Note that there are a bunch of these files, these may
  not be  all of them.  You will find them quick enough by trying to
  compile ANY C program, even one which does NOTHING.

Tadpole 68K (m68k-tadpole-sysv)

  Changes merged in 19.1.

  You may need to edit Makefile to change the variables LIBDIR and
  BINDIR from /usr/local to /usr/contrib.

  To give movemail access to /usr/mail, you may need to execute

    chmod 2755 etc/movemail; chgrp mail etc/movemail

Tahoe (tahoe-tahoe-bsd4.2 or tahoe-tahoe-bsd4.3)

  18.52 was known to work on some Tahoes, but a compiler bug intervenes
  on others.  Some Emacs versions have worked in Unisys 1r4
  (not in 1r3) and CCI I.21.

  If you have trouble compiling `lib-src/loadst.c', turn off the definition
  of DKSTAT_HEADER_FILE in `src/m/tahoe.h'.

Tandem Integrity S2 (mips-tandem-sysv)

  Changes merged in 18.56 but subprocess support is turned off.
  You will probably want to see if you can make subprocesses work.

  You must edit `lib-src/Makefile' to define LOADLIBES = -mld.

Tektronix 16000 box (6130?) (ns16k-tektronix-bsd)

  Emacs 17.61 worked.

Tektronix 4300 (m68k-tektronix-bsd)

  Emacs 18.51 worked.

Titan P2 or P3 (titan-titan-sysv)

  Changes probably merged in version 19.

Ustation E30 (SS5E) (m68k-unisys-unipl)

  Changes merged in 18.52; don't know whether they work.

Vaxen running Berkeley Unix (vax-dec-bsd4.1, vax-dec-bsd4.2, vax-dec-bsd4.3),
	      Ultrix (vax-dec-ultrix),
              System V (vax-dec-sysv0, vax-dec-sysv2), or
              VMS (vax-dec-vms)

  Works.

  See under Ultrix for problems using X windows on Ultrix (vax-dec-ultrix).

  18.27 worked on System V rel 2 (vax-dec-sysv2).

  18.36 worked on System V rel 0 (vax-dec-sysv0).

  18.36 was believed to work on VMS.  Addition of features is necessary
  to make this Emacs version more usable.

Whitechapel MG1 (ns16k-whitechapel-?)

  May work.  Supposedly no changes were needed except in `src/m/mg1.h'
  file.  I do not know what Unix version runs on them.

Wicat (m68k-wicat-sysv)

  Changes merged as of 18.6; whether they work is unknown.
  See comments in `src/m/wicat.h' for things you should change
  depending on the system and compiler version you have.

Here is a summary of the systems supported:

Berkeley 4.1 (bsd4.1)

  Works on vaxes.

Berkeley 4.2 (bsd4.2)

  Works on several machines.

Berkeley 4.3 (bsd4.3)

  Works, on Vaxes at least.

Microport

  See under "Intel 386".

System V rel 0 (usg5.0)

  Works, on Vaxes and 3bxxx's.
  There are some problems in 18.37 due to shortnames/cccp problems:
  use the emacs 17 cpp if you have it.

System V rel 2 (usg5.2)

  Works on various machines.
  On some (maybe all) machines the library -lPW exists and contains
  a version of `alloca'.  On these machines, to use it, put
     #define HAVE_ALLOCA
     #define LIB_STANDARD -lPW -lc
  in the `src/m/MACHINENAME.h' file for the machine.

  If you find that the character Meta-DEL makes Emacs crash,
  find where function init_sys_modes in sysdep.c sets sg.c_cc[VQUIT]
  and make it store 7 there.  I have as yet no evidence of whether
  this problem, known in HP-UX, exists in other system V versions.

System V rel 2.2 (usg5.2.2)

  In 5.2.2 AT&T undid, incompatibly, their previous incompatible
  change to the way the nlist library is called.  A different s- file
  is used to enable the other interface.

  They call themselves the right choice--can't they choose?

  Emacs version 18 unexec is currently not working properly
  on 5.2.2.  Nobody knows why yet.  A workaround is to define
  NO_REMAP.  It is not yet known whether this applies to all
  machines running 5.2.2.

System V rel 3 (usg5.3)

  Some versions of this system support ptys and BSD-style sockets.
  On such systems, you should define HAVE_PTYS and HAVE_SOCKETS in config.h.

  If you want to link Emacs with shared libraries, define
  USG_SHARED_LIBRARIES.

  You may have to add ANSI idempotence #-lines to your sys/types.h
  file to get Emacs to compile correctly.  This may be necessary on
  other pre-ANSI systems as well.

  On an AT&T 6386WGS using System V Release 3.2 and X11R3, the X support
  cannot be made to work.  Whether or not the GNU relocating malloc is
  used, the symptom is that the first call Emacs makes to sbrk(0) returns
  (char *)-1.  Sorry, you're stuck with character-only mode.  Try
  installing Xfree86 to fix this.

System V rel 4.0.3 and 4.0.4 (usg5.4)

  Supported, including shared libraries for ELF, but ptys do not work
  because TIOCGPGRP fails to work on ptys (but Dell 2.2 seems to have
  fixed this).  This failure is probably due to a misunderstanding of
  the consequences of the POSIX spec: many system designers mistakenly
  think that POSIX requires this feature to fail.  This is untrue;
  ptys are an extension, and POSIX says that extensions *when used*
  may change the action of standard facilities in any fashion.

  The standard C preprocessor may generate xmakefile incorrectly.  However,
  /lib/cpp will work, so use `make CPP=/lib/cpp'.  Standard cpp
  seems to work OK under Dell 2.2.

  Some versions 3 and earlier of V.4, on the Intel 386 and 860, had
  problems in the X11 libraries.  These prevent Emacs from working
  with X.  You can use Emacs with X provided your copy of X is based
  on X11 release 4 or newer, or is Dell's 2.2 (which is a 4.0.3).
  Unfortunately, the only way you can tell whether your X11 library is
  new enough is to try compiling Emacs to use X.  If emacs runs, your
  X11 library is new enough.

  In this context, GSV4 and GSV4i are alternate names for X11R4.
  OL2.* is X11R3 based.  OL3 is in between X11R3 and X11R4, and may or
  may not work, depending on who made the Unix system.  If the library
  libXol is part of the X distribution, then you have X11R3 and Emacs
  won't work with X.

  Most versions of V.4 support sockets.  If `/usr/lib/libsocket.so'
  exists, your system supports them.  If yours does not, you must add
  #undef HAVE_SOCKETS in config.h, after the inclusion of s-usg5-4.h.
  (Any system that supports Internet should implement sockets.)

Ultrix (bsd4.3)

  Recent versions of Ultrix appear to support the features of Berkeley 4.3.
  Ultrix was at the BSD 4.2 level for a long time after BSD 4.3 came out.

  Ultrix 3.0 has incompatibilities in its X library if you have the
  Ultrix version of X (UWS version 2.0).  To solve them, you need to
  prevent XvmsAlloc.o in Xlib from being used.  Israel Pinkas says:

    I added the following lines to config.h after the X defines:

    #if defined(ultrix) && defined(X11)
    #define OBJECTS_SYSTEM calloc.o
    #endif

    Then I ran the following:

    ar x /usr/lib/libc.a calloc.o

  The problem is said to be gone in UWS version 2.1.

Uniplus 5.2 (unipl5.2)

  Works, on Dual machines at least.

VMS (vmsM.N)

  Works except for certain features (directory listing, dired,
  sending and receiving mail) that use synchronous subprocesses.
  We need people to write alternative implementations of these
  facilities.

  The config file s/vms5-5.h may be right for some earlier versions;
  please let us know what happens when you try it in VMS versions 5.0
  thru 5.4.

  Note that Emacs for VMS is usually distributed in a special VMS
  distribution.  See the file ../vms/VMSINSTALL for info on moving
  Unix distributions to VMS, and other VMS-related topics.

Xenix (xenix)

  Should work in 18.50, but you will need to edit the files
  `lib-src/Makefile' and `src/ymakefile'
  (see the comments that mention "Xenix" for what to change.)
  Compiling Emacs with -O is said not to work.

  If you want Emacs to work with Smail (installed as /usr/bin/smail)
  then add the line   #define SMAIL  to config.h.

  The file etc/XENIX suggests some useful things to do to Xenix
  to make the Emacs meta key work.
