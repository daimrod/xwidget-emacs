This file is about changes in the Emacs "lexbind" branch.


* Lisp changes in Emacs 23.1

** The `lexical-binding' lets code use lexical scoping for local variables.
It is typically set via file-local variables, in which case it applies to
all the code in that file.

** Lexically scoped interpreted functions are represented with a new form
of function value which looks like (closure ENV lambda ARGS &rest BODY).
