GNU Emacs for Mac OS

This directory contains the files needed to build GNU Emacs on the Mac
OS (8.1-9.0).  Many of the major features of the Unix version are
supported: multiple frames, colors, scroll bars, menu bars, use of the
mouse, fontsets, international characters, input methods, and coding
systems.

Mac OS specific support includes document drag-and-drop in the Finder,
transfer of text to and from other applications via the clipboard, and
sending AppleScript commands to other applications from Emacs.

The following are not yet supported: unexec (dump-emacs), asynchronous
subprocesses (start-process), and networking
(open-network-connection).

There is basic support for synchronous subprocesses (call-process)
although Unix commands that are used will need to be ported to the
Mac.

Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 5 or Pro 6 or MPW-GM (August 2000) can be
used to build Emacs on the Mac OS.  See the INSTALL file in this
directory for instructions on building Emacs.

Binary distributions are available at

  http://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/index.html

At this site you can also find an FAQ, mailing lists, and dicussion
forums for discussing issues related to running GNU Emacs on Mac OS.
