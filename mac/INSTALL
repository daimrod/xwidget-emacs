* BUILDING EMACS ON THE MAC OS     -*- outline -*-

You can use either Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 5 or 6 or MPW-GM
(Aug. 2000) to build Emacs.  MPW-GM can be downloaded free of charge
from Apple at

  http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/

You will need MPW-GM to build the make-docfile utility and to generate
the doc string file DOC.

To decompress files, you can use MacGzip from

  http://persephone.cps.unizar.es/~spd/gzip

and to untar them, you can use tar 4.0 from

  http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/cmp/tar-40b.hqx

(Optional) If you wish to fetch files from the Emacs CVS repository
directly to your Mac, you can use the CVS client MacCVS, which can be
downloaded from

  http://www.wincvs.org/

(Optional) A subset of the fonts from the GNU intlfonts-1.2
distribution converted to NFNT format can be obtained from

  ftp://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/pub/mac-emacs/GNU-fonts.smi.bin

* BUILDING EMACS

To build Emacs in the MPW Shell, simply set the directory to
...:emacs:mac: and build the target Emacs of the make file
makefile.mpw.  I.e., execute the commands

  make Emacs -f makefile.MPW > Emacs.MakeScript
  Emacs.MakeScript

To build Emacs using CodeWarrior, start up the CodeWarrior IDE, choose
File->Import Project...  and select the file emacs-cw5.mcp.xml or
emacs-cw6.mcp.xml, depending on which verison of CodeWarrior used.
When prompted to save the project, navigate to same directory as the
file emacs-cw[56].mcp.xml, name it emacs-cw5.mcp or emacs-cw6.mcp, and
save it there.  Then choose Project->Make.  Note that this does not
build the DOC file.  To do so, use MPW and build the target "Doc" in
makefile.MPW.

Once built, the Emacs application (Emacs CW or Emacs MPW) can be
launched where it is created.

To build an optimized version of Emacs in CodeWarrior, change the
value in the Emacs Settings->Code Generation->Global Optimization
dialog.  To build a version for profiling, check the Profiler
Information box in the Emacs Settings->Code Generation->PPC Processor
dialog and include the Profiler PPC.Lib library.

To build optimized or debugging version of Emacs in MPW, follow the
comment in makefile.MPW to enable the -opt speed or -sym on option
(see note below).

The Mac version requires compiled Lisp files to be present in the lisp
directory to run properly.  It is cumbersome to bootstrap from only
the Lisp source files.  One way of getting the compiled Lisp files is
to build Emacs once on, say, a Unix system and transfer that directory
to the Mac.  Note that linefeed conversion must be disabled when
transferring compiled Lisp files.

An alternative is to unzip and untar the archive lisp-elc.tgz.  An
older version of frame.elc in the archive may cause a problem when the
Mac version starts up.  If this is the case, simply remove or rename
that file.  Then once Emacs runs, you can invoke
byte-recompile-directory on the lisp directory to byte-compile all
out-of-date Lisp files.

You may also need to run update-autoloads-from-directories on the lisp
directory to bring loaddefs.el up-to-date.

* NOTES

Emacs should build and run on a PowerMac running Mac OS 8.1 - 9.0.

You will need around 100 MB of disk space for the source files and
intermediate files.

It will not run on machines with more than 256 MB of physical or
virtual memory.

Currently there is no support for building the LEIM directory on the
Mac.  However, it can be built on another platform and transferred to
the Mac.

When Emacs is built with "-opt speed" enabled in makefile.MPW,
optimization causes the functions reset_buffer_local_variables in
buffer.c and syms_of_lread in lread.c to crash.  Avoid this by
enclosing them in the following pragmas.

  #pragma options opt off

  <function definition...>

  #pragma options opt reset

To use the same icon as when Emacs is built on Windows NT, define
GNU_ICON in mac/src/Emacs.r.
