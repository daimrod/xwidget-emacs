## Helper script for those building Emacs from bzr without autoconf etc.
## This installs some pre-generated versions of the automatically
## generated files.  It is highly recommended to install the necessary
## tools instead of using this.  Note that if eg configure.in
## is updated, the next time you run make it will attempt to
## regenerate configure and will fail if you do not have the required
## tools.  You will have to run this script again.

if test ! -e config.in; then
    echo "You must run this script from the autogen/ directory."
    exit 1
fi

cp configure aclocal.m4 ../
cp config.in ../src/
cp Makefile.in ../lib/

echo "You can now run configure"
