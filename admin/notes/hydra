NOTES FOR EMACS CONTINUOUS BUILD ON HYDRA

A continuous build for Emacs trunk can be found at
http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/emacs-trunk

* It builds (and runs ERT tests) on these platforms:
i686-cygwin
i686-freebsd
i686-linux
x86_64-darwin
x86_64-linux

* Mail notifications
In addition to the web interface, Hydra can send notifications by
email when the build status of a project changesâ€”e.g., from
`SUCCEEDED' to `FAILED'.  It sends notifications about build status in
Emacs trunk to emacs-buildstatus@gnu.org.

If you want to receive these notifications, please subscribe at
http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-buildstatus

* The Emacs jobset consists of the following jobs:

** The `tarball' job
which gets the source tree as input, and is just a `make dist' after
some autoconf/-make or bootstrap script.

** The `build' job
which gets the result of the tarball job as input, together with
system identifier, this job basically does a normal make and make install.

** The 'coverage' job
is now running `make check'.

* Nix expressions
The recipe for GNU Emacs are available via Git:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hydra-recipes.git/tree/emacs

To modify the build job, email the patch to hydra-users@gnu.org.  The
build recipes are written in the Nix language.

* Other Information
For a list of other GNU packages that have a continuous build on
Hydra, see http://hydra.nixos.org/project/gnu

See http://www.gnu.org/software/devel.html#Hydra for more information.
