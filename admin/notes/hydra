which gets the source tree as input, and is just a `make dist' after
some autoconf/-make or bootstrap script.

** The `build' job
which gets the result of the tarball job as input, together with
system identifier, this job basically does a normal make, make check,
make install.

** The 'coverage' job
is now running `make check'.
