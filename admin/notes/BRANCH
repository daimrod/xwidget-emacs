You can view the available Emacs branches at

http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/r/emacs/

Development normally takes places on the trunk.
Sometimes specialized features are developed on separate branches
before possibly being merged to the trunk.

Development is discussed on the emacs-devel mailing list.

Sometime before the release of a new major version of Emacs (eg 23.2),
a "feature freeze" is imposed on the trunk.  No new features may be
added after this point.  This is usually some months before the release.

Shortly before the release, a release branch is created, and the
trunk is then free for development.
For example, "emacs-23" for Emacs 23.2 and later, "EMACS_23_1_RC" for
23.1, "EMACS_22_BASE" for 22.x, and "EMACS_21_1_RC" for 21.x.

Traditionally only bug-fixes were allowed in minor releases.
Recently (22.x, 23.2), self-contained new features were allowed on a
case-by-case basis.

If you are looking at this file in a branch other than the trunk,
there may be some branch-specific documentation below this line.
