This file describes the Arch branch in which it is maintained.
Everything below the line is branch-specific.
________________________________________________________________________

This is the "multi-tty" branch.  It contains a version of Emacs that
is able to create frames on multiple display devices and display
types, including multiple tty devices and tty+X combined sessions.
The branch has an enhanced version of emacsclient that is capable of
opening a new Emacs frame on the terminal it runs on.

Commit access to the multi-tty branch is only available to its
maintainer, Károly LÅ‘rentey (lorentey@elte.hu).  The best way to
contribute to the project is to create your own public Arch branch,
and publish your changes there.  (I will then be able to easily "pull"
your changes into the multi-tty branch.)

The branch is scheduled for inclusion in the next major release of
Emacs, version 22.

Please read the file README.multi-tty in the base directory for
details.
