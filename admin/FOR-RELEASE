Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Regenerate the pdf versions of the reference cards in etc/refcards/.

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

Emacs 22 translators:

LANG	Translator            Status
cs	Pavel Janík           
de	Sven Joachim          
fr	Eric Jacoboni         
pl	Włodek Bzyl           
pt-br	Rodrigo Real          
ru	Alex Ott              
sk	Miroslav Vaško        

** Remove temporary +++/--- lines in NEWS.

** Try to reorder NEWS: most important things first, related items together.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay display artifact: trace left behind
Verify that the new font backend eliminates this and other Cleartype related
problems.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

* BUGS WAITING FOR MORE USER INPUT

** raman@users.sf.net, sep 7: Emacs 23.0.50: Segfaults in alloc.c (batch process)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg00690.html

** undefined reference getopt_long
Report by Daniel C. Bastos <dbast0s@yahoo.com.br> on bug-gnu-emacs
from 2007-08-27.  Impossible to procede without more input from OP (as
of 20070912, emails are bouncing) or someone else who can reproduce this.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01497.html

** emacs-22.1 with GTK problems (with patches)
Only outstanding issue seems to be whether Solaris 2.6 GTK can be
supported in the absence of recursive mutexes, via a change to
alloc.c, or whether configure should abort.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00055.html

* BUGS

** Document the changes introduced by multi-tty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01639.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01602.html

** Does deleting frames run Lisp code?  If so, can we get rid of that?
It is a dangerous design.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01330.html

** Why were the calls to x_fully_uncatch_errors commented out in eval.c?
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01987.html

** grep et al should use font-lock to do highlighting, so that they respect font-lock-mode.
"can't turn off font-lock"
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg00548.html

** mah@everybody.org, Sep 18: erc causes emacs to hang with multi-tty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01765.html

** jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk, Sep 18: before-string property has no effect if display property is empty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00094.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01816.html

** sdl.web@gmail.com, Sep 24: TLS infinite loop.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01720.html

** herring@lanl.gov: find-func: can no longer find adviced subrs
This ought to work.

** \\{...} produces duplicate entries
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-05/msg00209.html

** menu indications of key bindings for remapped commands
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-05/msg01339.html

** rms: gnus-dired.el is a mistake.  Those features should not
be part of Gnus.  They should be moved to some other part of Emacs.
rsteib: Gnus dependencies in `gnus-dired.el' (and `mailcap.el') have been
minimized.  I don't know what is left to do here.

** sdl.web@gmail.com, 30 Oct: ps-lpr-switches has no effect

** timh@insightful.com, 9 Nov: X-coding-system incompatibility, and workaround

** Fix problem with mode-name in SGML mode.
If mode-name stays non-string, add NEWS entry and doc fix.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-11/msg02048.html

** multi-tty does not work correctly.
If the server is started from a tty frame and emacsclient creates an
X11 frame, the tty frame gets confused, it thinks it is an X11 frame
when trying to do a C-z.  This worked with server.el version 1.136, it
broke after that.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-12/msg00545.html
Also emacsclient does not work on Windows, it also worked with
server.el version 1.136.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg00710.html

** diff mode change for missing spaces in -u format.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-11/msg01990.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg01114.html

** skeleton bug? Or is it now working as documented?
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg01335.html

** move verilog-mode.el compile patterns into compile.el?
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg00234.html


** unicode-merge issues:

** The data segment size increased after the unicode-2 merge.
The "data" size increased for emacs from ~4MB to ~11MB on x86.
The temacs sizes are comparable.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-10/msg00951.html

** ps-prin1.ps: "Handle multiple strings in a line"
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-02/msg00079.html
Change lost?

** ucs-mule-8859-to-mule-unicode
This has been removed (together with ucs-tables.el), but
latin1-disp.el still uses it.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-02/msg00066.html

** auto-compose-current-font
This has been removed, but is still used in
devan-util.el, mlm-util.el, tibet-util.el, tml-util.el
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-02/msg00064.html

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-02/msg00068.html
