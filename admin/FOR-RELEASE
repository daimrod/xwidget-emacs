Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Regenerate the postscript files of the reference cards in etc.

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** set-frame-size for frame without minibuffer loses mode line
Probably a Windows only bug.  Reported by Drew Adams on bug-gnu-emacs on
2007-08-07.  It seems that the bug manifests itself only if resizing the
frame makes the menu bar wrap before.  On 2007-08-16 Glenn Morris
reported on emacs-devel that he was not able to reproduce the bug on a
GNU/Linux system.

* BUGS WAITING FOR MORE USER INPUT

** undefined reference getopt_long
Report by Daniel C. Bastos <dbast0s@yahoo.com.br> on bug-gnu-emacs
from 2007-08-27.  Impossible to procede without more input from OP (as
of 20070912, emails are bouncing) or someone else who can reproduce this.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01497.html

** TAGS buffer generates spurious undo warnings
Waiting for recipe to produce these warnings.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00070.html

** emacs-22.1 with GTK problems (with patches)
Only outstanding issue seems to be whether Solaris 2.6 GTK can be
supported in the absence of recursive mutexes, via a change to
alloc.c, or whether configure should abort.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00055.html

* BUGS

** ams@gnu.org, 9 July: eshell and external commands
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg00385.html

** latex mode, nexted subscripts are unreadable
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2007-09/msg00020.html

** jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk, Sep 19: redisplay goes horribly wrong when a
before-string contains multiple display properties
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg02442.html

** jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk, Sep 19: part of display property on before-string
 property is not displayed
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-10/msg00138.html

** bojohan+news@dd.chalmers.se, Sep 21:
 tooltip frame uses (class mono) when processing defface specs
(Actually it uses no class at all.)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01793.html

** Frame title no more updated after calling `set-frame-configuration'
Report by Sebastien Rocca Serra <sroccaserra@gmail.com> on emacs-devel
from 2007-08-30.  martin rudalics has a potential patch.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01632.html

* FIXES FOR EMACS 22.3

Here we list any small fixes that arrived too late for Emacs 22.2, but
that should be installed on the release branch after 22.2 is released.

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
