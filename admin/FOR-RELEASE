Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Cleanup temporary +++/--- lines in etc/NEWS.

** Regenerate the postscript files of the reference cards in etc.

** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

** Send an email to the various distributions, including the GNOME
and KDE projects, to use the new Emacs icons in etc/images/icons.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay  display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

* BUGS

** spurious scrolling bug
RMS has seen this too, happening during idle time, but cannot reproduce it.

** lennart.borgman@gmail.com, Apr 11: before-string in overlay
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2007-04/msg00153.html

** cyd@stupidchicken.com, Apr 12: display margin errors on a tty
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2007-04/msg00272.html

* DOCUMENTATION

** ryanmcgeary@hotmail.com, Apr 9: x-display-pixel-width
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-04/msg00400.html
Not a bug, but doc must be updated.

** Several manuals have old dates on the cover page.

** Every manual should be under the GFDL.  dired-x isn't.

** Every manual should contain a copy of the GFDL.

** A couple of manuals (flymake, newsticker) don't have an "@insertcopying"
line in the title page, so the copyright doesn't appear when they're 
processed.  (I'd say the same about widget, but that doesn't have a
title page.)

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
