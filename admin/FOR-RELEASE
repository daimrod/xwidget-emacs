* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** set-frame-size for frame without minibuffer loses mode line
Probably a Windows only bug.  Reported by Drew Adams on bug-gnu-emacs on
2007-08-07.  It seems that the bug manifests itself only if resizing the
frame makes the menu bar wrap before.  On 2007-08-16 Glenn Morris
reported on emacs-devel that he was not able to reproduce the bug on a
GNU/Linux system.

* FIXES FOR EMACS 22.3

Here we list any small fixes that arrived too late for Emacs 22.2, but
that should be installed on the release branch after 22.2 is released.

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
