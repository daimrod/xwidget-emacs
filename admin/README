This directory contains scripts and other things useful for developing
and maintaining Emacs.  These files are not part of Emacs releases
because they are not deemed generally useful, and you have to know
what you do when using them.

Brief description of scripts found here:

build-configs		build Emacs in various configurations
check-doc-strings	check doc strings against documentation
make-emacs		build Emacs in various ways
revdiff			get CVS diffs of files
quick-install-emacs	install emacs quickly (`incrementally')
