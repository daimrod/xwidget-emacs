This directory contains scripts and other things useful for developing
and maintaining Emacs.  These files are not part of Emacs releases
because they are not deemed generally useful, and you have to know
what you do when using them.

Brief description of scripts found here:

build-configs	build Emacs in various configurations
make-emacs	build Emacs in various ways
revdiff		get CVS diffs of files
