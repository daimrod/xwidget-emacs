/* Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM, pretending that
   this is at line FROMVPOS, column FROMHPOS, until reaching buffer
   offset TO or line TOVPOS, column TOHPOS (whichever comes first),
   and return the ending buffer position and screen location.  If we
   can't hit the requested column exactly (because of a tab or other
   multi-column character), overshoot.

   WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;
   compute_motion uses this to handle continuation lines and such.
   HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
   margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
   TAB_OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
   being displayed, perhaps because of a continuation line or
   something.

   compute_motion returns a pointer to a struct position.  The bufpos
   member gives the buffer position at the end of the scan, and hpos
   and vpos give its cartesian location.  prevhpos is the column at
   which the character before bufpos started, and contin is non-zero
   if we reached the current line by continuing the previous.

   Note that FROMHPOS and TOHPOS should be expressed in real screen
   columns, taking HSCROLL and the truncation glyph at the left margin
   into account.  That is, beginning-of-line moves you to the hpos
   -HSCROLL + (HSCROLL > 0).

   Note that FROMHPOS and TOHPOS should be expressed in real screen
   columns, taking HSCROLL and the truncation glyph at the left margin
   into account.  That is, beginning-of-line moves you to the hpos
   -HSCROLL + (HSCROLL > 0).

   For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE
   of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM
   and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMVPOS and FROMHPOS.
   Pass the buffer's ZV as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
   visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOVPOS and
   TOHPOS.  

   When displaying in window w, a typical formula for WIDTH is:

	window_width - 1
	 - (has_vertical_scroll_bars
	    ? FRAME_SCROLL_BAR_COLS (XFRAME (window->frame))
	    : (window_width + window_left != frame_width))

	where
	  window_width is XFASTINT (w->width),
	  window_left is XFASTINT (w->left),
	  has_vertical_scroll_bars is
	    FRAME_HAS_VERTICAL_SCROLL_BARS (XFRAME (WINDOW_FRAME (window)))
	  and frame_width = FRAME_WIDTH (XFRAME (window->frame))

   Or you can let window_internal_width do this all for you, and write:
	window_internal_width (w) - 1

   The `-1' accounts for the continuation-line backslashes; the rest
   accounts for window borders if the window is split horizontally, and
   the scroll bars if they are turned on.  */

Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM,\n\
assuming it is at position FROMPOS--a cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--\n\
to position TO or position TOPOS--another cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--\n\
and return the ending buffer position and screen location.\n\
\n\
There are three additional arguments:\n\
\n\
WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;\n\
this affects handling of continuation lines.\n\
This is usually the value returned by `window-width', less one (to allow\n\
for the continuation glyph).\n\
\n\
OFFSETS is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).\n\
HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left\n\
margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.\n\
TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't\n\
being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.\n\
If OFFSETS is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.\n\
\n\
WINDOW is the window to operate on.  Currently this is used only to\n\
find the display table.  It does not matter what buffer WINDOW displays;\n\
`compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.\n\
\n\
The value is a list of five elements:\n\
  (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)\n\
POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.\n\
VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.\n\
HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.\n\
\n\
PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.\n\
CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.\n\
\n\
For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE\n\
of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM\n\
and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMPOS.\n\
Pass the buffer's (point-max) as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the\n\
visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOPOS.")
