   one display position on the screen.

   Emacs can use 8-bit or 16-bit values to represent GLYPHs.  Under X
   windows, 16-bit GLYPHs allow you to display characters from fonts
   too large to be indexed by 8 bits alone, but drawing with 16-bit GLYPHs 
   is usually quite a bit slower than drawing with 8-bit GLYPHs.  */
