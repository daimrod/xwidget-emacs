# This is the distribution Makefile for Emacs.  config.emacs can make
# most of the changes to this file you might want, so try that first.

# make all	to compile and build Emacs
# make install	to install it
# make install.sysv  to install on system V.
# make install.xenix  to install on Xenix
# make tags	to update tags tables
#
# make distclean	to delete everything that wasn't in the distribution
#	This is a very dangerous thing to do!
# make clean
#       This is a little less dangerous.

SHELL = /bin/sh

# ==================== Where to install things ====================
# Note that on system V you must change MANDIR to /usr/local/man/man1.

# Where to install all of Emacs's data files - the lisp code,
# documentation tree, and the architecture-dependent and -independent
# libraries.  If this is not the directory we're building under
# already, the `install' targets will move or copy it there.  The
# default definitions for the variables below are expressed in terms
# of this one, so you may not need to change them.
LIBROOT=/u/src/emacs/19.0

# This is where the `install' make target should place the binaries
# people will want to run directly (like etags and Emacs itself).
INSTALLBIN=/usr/local/bin

# Emacs will search this path to find its elisp files.  This should be
# a colon-separated list of directories.  Strictly speaking, all the
# elisp files should go under DATADIR (below), since both elisp source
# and compiled elisp are completely portable, but it's traditional to
# give the lisp files their own subdirectory.
LISPPATH=/u/src/emacs/19.0/lisp

# Emacs will look here for its architecture-independent files (like
# the tutorial and the zippy database).
DATADIR=/u/src/emacs/19.0/share-lib

# Emacs will look here for its architecture-dependent files, like
# executables for its utilities.
LIBDIR=/u/src/emacs/19.0/arch-lib

# The locking directory, where the Emacs locking code keeps track of
# which files are currently being edited.
LOCKDIR=/u/src/emacs/19.0/lock

# This is where the `install' make target should place the man pages
# for the binaries it installs.
MANDIR= /usr/man/man1



# Flags passed down to subdirectory makefiles.
MFLAGS=

# Subdirectories to make recursively.  `lisp' is not included
# because the compiled lisp files are part of the distribution
# and you cannot remake them without installing Emacs first.
SUBDIR= lib-src src

# Subdirectories to install
COPYDIR= arch-lib share-lib info lisp

# Subdirectories to clean
